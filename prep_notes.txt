Anything mentor didn’t mention?
- MasonHacks
- The Academist
- CyberPatriot
- MIT
What's your role on the team?
- Programming Captain, but I involve myself with outreach as well despite not being a formal member of that subteam.
What do you want to do in the future?
- First, I want to go to college, of course. For me, I think it’s definitely the best course of action, since I’m planning on going into knowledge industry (CS)
- Afterward, I don’t yet know what I’ll do - CS industry changes quickly.
- Would like to work for tech company
- May start my own company if there’s an opportunity
- Don’t yet know what CS industry will be like when I graduate.
- Silicon Valley maybe, BUT, would love to live abroad, experience culture, and support weaker economies. (interest in international community & econ)
When's an experience you learned from?
- Stepping on Carter’s toes
Why do you think you were nominated for this award?
- Concretely speaking, I have my hands in both outreach & robot
- Abstractly speaking, there are other members of my team who work very hard, however, (not to sound vain) I think that I see our team and the work we do in a different way from other members of my team.
- Other members of my team are very passionate and talented, for sure, but I think I have an appreciation for what the FIRST model can do that other members don't quite see.
- People sometimes like to make jokes about gracious professionalism, This Isn't A Robot video, etc., but I genuinely empathize with the goals of FIRST in that regard.
- ALSO I have worked to make the team a much more hospitable place. Couldn't do very much about it when I was freshman, but now by being in control and treating the younger kids with respect and all, I think the team environment has improved, though there is still work to do.
- Hope I don't sound like a self-absorbed ass...
What does leadership mean to you?
- Give anecdote about team being mean and improving through example-setting
