Hello, and thank you for your attention to this email!

I was honored to find out yesterday that I have been selected as one of the FRC Dean's List candidates who will advance to the 2018 CHS District Championship. I was, however, sadly misinformed prior to that announcement about whether I would need to be re-interviewed at that event.

Unfortunately, I signed up over a year ago for a Spanish language exchange program to Chile, before the dates for the District Championship were set. This registration was binding, so once I became aware of the scheduling conflict which occurred between this language exchange program and the Championship, there was nothing I could do.

To add to the inconvenience of this situation, I was told (by a source I ought to have better fact-checked) that there would be no interview taking place at the District Championship, and as such thought I would be able to accept the nomination of my mentors despite my unfortunate absence from the Championship this season. I've performed the necessary training and made arrangements for my competition duties to be handled, so there is no concern on at least that front. However, I will not be able to be present at a standard interview with the Dean's List judges this coming weekend.

I am hoping, if it isn't too much of an inconvenience to FIRST Chesapeake, that there is an alternative method by which I can provide my interview. I would be more than happy to answer questions over Skype or another such service, or provide written responses to judging questions.

I hope I have not inconvenienced FIRST Chesapeake with my absence or correspondence.

Please let me know if there is some alternative protocol through which I could perform my re-interview such as to continue my consideration for inclusion in this year's Dean's List.

Thank you once again for your assistance,
Erik Boesen
