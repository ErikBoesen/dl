Here you can find all the resources and documents I used during the process of selection for the FRC Dean's List award. I won the award in 2018.

The files within this repository are as follows:
* `nomination.txt`: the essay written by my team's mentor nominating me for the award.
* `rescheduling_letter.txt`: an email I sent to my district's Dean's List judges requesting that my interview be run over Skype given that I was on an exchange trip in Chile at the time.
* `prep_notes.txt`: preparatory notes which I wrote in order to have a sense of about what to talk and how to respond to questions during my second interview.

Lessons learned:
* Always prepare. I was advised by a former finalist not to take notes as too scripted an interview could seem suspicious or off-putting for judges. As such, I did not prepare for my first interview. During the interview I was unsure of what to talk about or respond to some questions. I prepared notes (`prep_notes.txt`) on what to discuss for the second interview at the District Championship, and my interview went much more smoothly.
